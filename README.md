### Finding a Conference

Tech conferences are not the only way to do public speaking. You can find
local users groups on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/) and similar sites that
might be interested in hearing your talks, as well!

#### Aggregators of CFPs and Conferences

A CFP is a "Call For Papers", "Call For Proposals", or "Call For
Participation" depending on the conference.

* [Papercall.io](https://www.papercall.io/cfps), tech with a DevOps focus
* [WikiCFP](http://wikicfp.com/cfp/), primarily academic and industry * conferences
* [DevOps Conferences](http://devopsconferences.org/)
* [Opensource.com Events Calendar](https://opensource.com/resources/conferences-and-events-monthly)
* [Central US Community Tech Events](http://www.davidgiard.com/CentralUSEvents.aspx)
* [Mozilla Tech CFPs](https://tchspk.rs/cfp) (all events welcome, not just Mozilla ones)
* [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/calls/) (Conferences and CFPs)
* [CFP Time](https://cfptime.org)
* [ConferenceList](https://conferencelist.co) (conferences only)

## History & acknowledgments

This collection of resources started as a [bibliography](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/10stepprogram/blob/master/resources.md) for [a public speaking tutorial](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/10stepprogram) written & presented by [VM (Vicky) Brasseur](https://vmbrasseur.com) and [Josh Berkus](https://github.com/jberkus).

Since that tutorial, the collection continued to grow as Vicky located new resources to add to the list. While the collection was public, it was buried. This repository brings it out into the light and makes it easy for everyone to locate, use, and contribute to it.

Immense thanks due to Josh for helping build the initial collection of resources. Thank you, Josh!
