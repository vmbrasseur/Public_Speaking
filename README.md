## History & acknowledgments

This collection of resources started as a [bibliography](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/10stepprogram/blob/master/resources.md) for [a public speaking tutorial](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/10stepprogram) written & presented by [VM (Vicky) Brasseur](https://vmbrasseur.com) and [Josh Berkus](https://github.com/jberkus).

Since that tutorial, the collection continued to grow as Vicky located new resources to add to the list. While the collection was public, it was buried. This repository brings it out into the light and makes it easy for everyone to locate, use, and contribute to it.

Immense thanks due to Josh for helping build the initial collection of resources. Thank you, Josh!
