# Translations of the Public_Speaking repository

* Translations are contained in language-specific directories.
* Each directory is named for the appropriate [language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation)
* Each directory should ideally contain translated versions of these files:
    * [README.md](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking/blob/master/README.md): Do **not** include the lists of resources themselves, only the explanatory text around them. We do not want to update the resource list in multiple places each time one is added.
    * [CODEOFCONDUCT.md](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking/blob/master/CODEOFCONDUCT.md)
    * [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    * [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking/blob/master/LICENSE.md): Only include this file if the translation is provided by Creative Commons themselves. Self-translated license files will not be accepted. Legal terminology is too tricky to leave to non-lawyers to translate.
* Please retain the names of the files (do not translate).

For an excellent example, please see the [pt-br](./pt-br) translations provided here by [@airtonzanon](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking/pull/28)
